## <span id="nerd_face">:nerd_face:</span> Work projects

I work on scientific machine learning projects using mostly Tensorflow and sometimes Pytorch. I have developed generative modeling techniques for data augmentation, data reduction and rare event probability estimation.

I also develop code for high-performance computing on CPU/GPU architectures. Lately, I have been developing HPC code for analytically reduced chemistry using symbolic mathematics.
