## <span id="nerd_face">:nerd_face:</span> Work projects

I work on scientific machine learning projects using mostly Tensorflow and sometimes Pytorch. I have developed generative modeling techniques for data augmentation, data reduction and rare event probability estimation.

I develop surrogate models using physics-informed neural nets to accelerate parameter identification for Li-ion battery models. 

|**[PINNSTRIPES](https://github.com/NREL/PINNSTRIPES)**|

I also develop code for high-performance computing on CPU/GPU architectures. Lately, I have been developing HPC code for analytically reduced chemistry using symbolic mathematics.

I am also working on scaling up the generative modeling regularization techniques I developed to handle large atmospheric datasets

I develop tools quickly generate OpenFOAM meshes that adapt to geometrical parameter variations. This is particularly useful for geometry optimization.
